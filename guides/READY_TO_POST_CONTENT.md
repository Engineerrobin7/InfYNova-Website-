Instead of boring marketing, we created something FUN:

🎮 A game where you design your dream phone and win real discounts (up to ₹10K)
📱 AR try-on to see the phone in your hand
🗳️ Community voting on actual product features
🔥 Challenges with ₹2.5 Lakhs in prizes
🖥️ Interactive NovaOS simulator
🎁 Referral program (₹1K per friend)

We're trying to prove Indian tech can be innovative AND fun.

Would love your feedback: infynova.in

What do you think? Too crazy? 😅

Edit: Wow, thanks for the response! Answering questions in comments.
```

### r/Android Post
```
Title: First smartphone brand to let you try the phone in AR before buying

Just launched an AR try-on feature for our smartphone.

Point your camera at your hand, see a life-size 3D model, change colors, capture photos.

Also built:
- A game where you can win discounts
- Community voting on features

Has any other brand done this? Seems like a no-brainer.

Also added:
- AR try-on
- Community voting
- Viral challenges (₹2.5L prizes)
