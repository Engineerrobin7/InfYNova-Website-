# Why India Needs InfYNova

## The Current State

**The top brands in India:**
- Samsung (South Korea)
- Xiaomi (China)
- Realme (China)
- Vivo (China)
- Oppo (China)

Where are the Indian brands?

## The Opportunity

India has:
- ✅ World-class engineers
- ✅ Thriving startup ecosystem
- ✅ Massive domestic market
- ✅ Manufacturing capabilities
- ✅ Government support (Make in India)

**What we lack is ambition.**

## Why InfYNova Matters
